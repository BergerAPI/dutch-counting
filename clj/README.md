# Dutch-Counting

This is a port of the official `dutch-counting`, which is written in Haxe, a language which was not made by the gods of programming.
For this reason I translated `dutch-counting` to a language, which real men actually use - Clojure.

# Running and Compiling

This uses [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/), so you'll need it to run `dutch-counting`.

## Running

```shell
$ lein run
```

## Compiling

```shell
$ lein uberjar
```
