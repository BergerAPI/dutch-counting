# Dutch-Counting

This is a port of the official `dutch-counting`, which is written in Haxe, a language which was not made by the gods of programming.
For this reason I translated `dutch-counting` to a language, which real men actually use - Scala.

# Running and Compiling

This uses [SBT](https://www.scala-sbt.org/), so you'll need it to run `dutch-counting`.

## Running

```shell
$ sbt run
```

## Compiling

```shell
$ sbt package
```
